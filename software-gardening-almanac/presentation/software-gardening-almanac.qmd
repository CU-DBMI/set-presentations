## Content Outline

- Intro slide

- Background, BSSw Fellowship

- Problem: code works for now but not for long
  - Sub problem: how much time do we lose to decay, repeated challenges, and seasonal change in the context of time?
  - How does code change over time?
  - Show git-of-theseus for something common like Pandas
  - "garden-of-theseus": maintenance over time is implied if we're going to continue using something!

- One solution: Software Gardening
- Software gardening article surface: https://bssw.io/blog_posts/long-term-software-gardening-strategies-for-cultivating-scientific-development-ecosystems

- Why a blog article isn't enough (it too faces the dynamics of time and decay)

- Background, Almanacs and their purpose https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac

- The handbook:
- A living community practicing software gardening to maintain practices
  - Planning for scale with common open source and inclusive documents
  - Providing a referenceable index of codes as "biomarkers" of patterns: https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/messages_overview.html

- People: Software gardener lattices; growing, supporting, and synergizing software gardeners
  - One applied chapter: growing open source; when is it apt to add a new maintainer?
    - SDA-P0001: Key-person dependency
    - Observation: A key-person dependency can lead to low growth and disaster longterm for a project.
    - Fix: 

- Code: software gardening senescence; how and why code changes with time
  - One applied chapter: dead code accumulation and ecosystem imbalance
    - SDA-C0001: accelerated decay and environment imbalance detection
    - Observation: More dead code accumulating without control over time
    - Fix: 

- Season: Software archeology, nowness, and proactivity; past, present, future, what patterns do we see
  - One applied chapter: seasonal climate checks
  - SDA-S0001: no automated seasonal checks for repository will lead to accelerated decay
  - Fix:
