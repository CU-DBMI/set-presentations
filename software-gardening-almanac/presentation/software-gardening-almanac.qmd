## Content Outline

- Intro slide

- Background, BSSw Fellowship

- Problem: code works for now but not for long
  - Sub problem: how much time do we lose to decay, repeated challenges, and seasonal change in the context of time?
  - How does code change over time?
  - Git-of-theseus: maintenance over time is implied if we're going to continue using something!
  - Show git-of-theseus for something common like Pandas
  - Show git-of-theseus for a near archived project? 

- One solution: Software Gardening
- Software gardening article surface: https://bssw.io/blog_posts/long-term-software-gardening-strategies-for-cultivating-scientific-development-ecosystems

- Why a blog article isn't enough (it too faces the dynamics of time and decay)

- Background, Almanacs and their purpose https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac

- The handbook:
- A living community practicing software gardening to maintain practices
- People: Software gardener lattices; growing, supporting, and synergizing software gardeners
- Code: software gardening senescence; how and why code changes with time
- Season: Software archeology, nowness, and proactivity; past, present, future, what patterns do we see

- One applied observation:
- Show demo for a "garden-of-theseus?"
