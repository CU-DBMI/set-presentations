    Outline:

    3 minutes: Background (what's ahead of us):
    Brief coverage of Cytomining projects (high-level, one-sentence overview)
    Pycytominer: ‚ÄúPycytominer is a suite of common functions used to process high dimensional readouts from high-throughput cell experiments.‚Äù
    DeepProfiler: DeepProfiler is a set of tools to use deep learning for analyzing imaging data in high-throughput biological experiments.
    Cytominer-eval: Cytominer-eval contains functions to calculate quality metrics for perturbation profiling experiments.
    CytoSnake (wayscience repo): Reproducible pipelines for processing high-dimensional systems morphology data with snakemake 
    CytoTable: CytoTable enables single-cell morphology data analysis by cleaning and transforming output data at scale. 
    Talk about number of issues in Pycytominer (~80) https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer/issues
    Talk about general progress made (PR's per month, etc?)
    Talk about number of developers working on each project (limited time / etc)
    Brainstorming: how can Pycytominer integrate better with CytoSnake, CytoTable, and other work we‚Äôre doing in the Way Lab? Think about specific things.

    3 minutes: Time:
    Software gardening ecosystem (time, habitat, and climate).
    Time effects code: decay, maintenance, etc.
    The ecosystem is constantly rebalancing
    How can we maintain a garden with limited time and rebalancing ecosystem?
    Talk about time and how it affects software.
    Talk about how time is effected by number of people involved (mythical person-month, complexity doesn't reduce with more people)
    Talk about how complexity is related to time, and how complexity affects decay

    3 minutes: Value:
    Cover what value means in the Cytomining context
    Talk about how value can be measured using time reduction, enhancements, etc (vitamin vs painkiller? Enhancements vs burden or risk reduction)
    Talk about Value streams (use pictures, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream) and how time affects things here for the Cytomining community
    Talk about interesting vs important

    6 minutes: Agile iteration:
    Talk about modularization of work, small chunks of reasonable work, and iterations from an Agile context
    Quick demonstration of using Time and Value to understand specific issues / features from a development perspective
    Reason through why high value low time/complexity tasks are a good way to be productive with changes
    Briefly cover that there are exceptions (high priority items which require circumventing the work)
    Talk about Github tools which can help with this process

    5 minutes: Backtracing:
    Identify the primary but distant goal
    Identify the step which takes place before that goal is reached
    Identify the smaller steps prior
    Check the flow of the steps (is there anything missing)
    Refinement: make sure the steps are accounted for.

## Measurements - Time

<br>

> _The key is not spending time but investing it._

[Steven R. Covey](https://twitter.com/StephenRCovey/status/154619150503915521)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Time

<br>

- ü™¥ Software Garden Code Decay
- üïë Hofstadter's Law
- üî¢ A rough calculation


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Time - Code Decay

<br>

- ü™¥ __Software Garden Code Decay__: your software garden is growing and decaying through time.
- Expect things to break as time goes on; the ecosystem changes fast!
- Because of this, we must be selective with how and what we spend our time on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Time - Code Decay

<br>

![](2023-06-06-13-25-39.png)

An example: [pycytominer#250](https://github.com/cytomining/pycytominer/issues/250)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Time - Code Decay

<br>

- üïë [__Hofstadter's Law__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law): "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law." ()
- Plan for delays; time taken will almost always be more than you expect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Time - Cytomining work stats

<br>

- Total open Cytomining repo issues: 130

_[Calculations reference](https://gist.github.com/d33bs/ad6e6d188bdf59e33f52b0517eb97a55)_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Time - A rough calculation

<br>

Let's assume each open issue needs a minimum:

- __1 hour of development__
- __2 hours of pull-request review / responses__

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Time - A rough calculation

<br>

That makes:

- 130 open issues * 3 hrs = __390 hours of work (minimum)__
- 390 hrs / 8 hrs = __48.75 full work days__
- 48.75 / 5 work days per week = __9.75 full work weeks__

üò¨

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Measurements - Value

<br>

> _People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. __It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.__ You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things._

[Steve Jobs](https://www.cnn.com/2012/10/04/tech/innovation/steve-jobs-quotes/index.html)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Value

<br>

- üíä Vitamin, Painkiller, or Cure?
- ‚öñÔ∏è Opportunity Cost
- üó∫Ô∏è Value Streams


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Value - Vitamin, Painkiller, or Cure

<br>

- üíä Will your software solution(s) be a vitamin, painkiller, or cure?
- Vitamins: enhance or strengthen existing things.
- Painkiller: remove barriers or roadbumps.
- Cure: completely resolve or predict resolutions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Value - Opportunity Cost

<br>

- ‚öñÔ∏è __Opportunity Cost__: choosing one thing may mean giving up another.
- There are more software challenges than we have development time to accomplish.
- Consider what solutions you strive for by respecting what didn't get attention.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Value - Value Streams

<br>

- üó∫Ô∏è __Value Streams__: the steps it takes from idea to value delivery to an audience.
- We often think about "waste" alongside value streams
- Value streams can get "blocked", meaning things aren't being completed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
