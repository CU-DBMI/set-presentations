  Development Prioritization <br>
  using Value and Time
description-meta: |
    Outline:

    - 3 minutes: Background (what's ahead of us):
      - Brief coverage of Cytomining projects (pycytominer, deepprofiler, cytominer-eval, cytotable )
      - Talk about number of issues in each project
      - Talk about number of developers working on each project
      - Talk about general progress made (PR's per month, etc?)

    - 3 minutes: Time:
      - Talk about time as a primary limitation and how it differs from money (one can't regain time)
      - Talk about how time is effected by number of people involved (mythical person-month, complexity doesn't reduce with more people)
      - Talk about how complexity is related to time

    - 3 minutes: Value:
      - Cover what value means in the cytomining context
      - Talk about how value can be measured using time reduction, enhancements, etc (vitamin vs painkiller? Enhancements vs burden or risk reduction)
      - Talk about Value streams (use pictures, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream) and how time effects things here for the Cytomining community

    - 6 minutes: Agile iteration:
      - Talk about modularization of work, small chunks of reasonable work, and iterations from an Agile context
      - Quick demonstration of using Time and Value to understand specific issues / features from a develepment perspective
      - Reason through why high value low time/complexity tasks are a good way to be productive with changes
      - Briefly cover that there are exceptions (high priority items which require circumventing the work)
      - Talk about Github tools which can help with this process

    - Jump into engagement:
      - 5 minutes: Initial work estimations:
        - Use a whiteboard, Jamboard, or similar to assign 3 issues to each of the meeting group
        - Talk about how each person should attempt to quantify the issues by time and value using a 1-5 point scale (1 being least, 5 being most)
        - Have each person interactively plot their issues on an X, Y chart available for all to see (X as Time, Y as Value?)
        - Give a reasonable amount of time to complete this (allow for thinking time / not rushing)

      - 10 minutes: estimation discussion
        - Did we estimate the items correctly? Should we adjust anything? (allow for person to speak up or for the group to talk through how they feel)
        - Once all items are talked through, "birds-eye view": what patterns do we see emerging?

      - 10 minutes: work classifications
        - Draw quadrants on the Time vs Value chart, talk about what each mean generally
        - Target the top left quadrant (high value, low time/complexity), talk through what items are there
        - Ask / consider: are we missing the mark by focusing on only these?
        - Are there stretch items which we could focus on?

      - 10 minutes: stretch items modularization
        - For the desirable stretch (high value, higher time/complexity), talk through modularization (breaking down the task into smaller chunks)
        - Take 1 or 2 examples here, how might these be broken down into 2-part or 3-part issues instead of 1 big one.
        - Talk through how we might plot these new "sub-tasks". 
        - How does this change things for the previous work classifications?

      - 10 minutes: work volunteering
        - Ask who should be involved in what? Are there any issues which speak to folks?
        - Use issue assignments in Github to delegate and provide responsible / observable actions (?)

    - 5 minutes: Meeting closeout
      - Recap the topics
      - Celebrate Cytomining progress (understanding and organizing the work is work!)
