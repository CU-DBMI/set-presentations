Research in the Way Lab involves intensive data engineering over high-dimensional single-cell morphology data from large-scale microscopy drug screening applications.
Software development surrounding this work often entails scalability (larger than memory data handling) and understandability (syntax complexity and software sustainability) challenges.

<p class="caption">Figure 2. A diagram illustrating data grammar as an abstract linguistic algorithm.</p>

To address these challenges we have developed a python package called CytoTable which implements "cross-language data grammar" capabilities (vocabulary + syntax = output) orchestrated with Parsl workflows.
Our vision is for CytoTable to increase consistency and reliability of data and enable more scientists to quickly access single-cell insights from microscopy images.

##  <i class="fa fa-circle fa-lg"></i> Data: Apache Arrow

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Chart showing relative memory size for data using various Python libraries.</p>

Apache Arrow represents a new frontier for data implementation flexibility, enabling a unified, multi-language, zero-copy format for in-memory analysis.
Arrow is like a high-performance Pandas dataframe which may be used across languages with fewer scalability challenges.

## <i class="fa fa-stream fa-lg"></i> Syntax: DuckDB SQL

![Figure 4. ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d33bs/CytoTable-benchmarks/init-benchmarks/notebooks/images/mem-read-size.png)
<p class="caption">Figure 4.</p>

Structured Query Language (SQL) through DuckDB provides an Arrow-compatible embedded database system optimized for vectorized execution.
DuckDB delivers in-memory capabilities through SQL, treating variable data as a loose collection of database tables without needing conversion.

## <i class="fa fa-file-alt fa-lg"></i> Output: Apache Parquet

<p class="caption">Figure 5. Chart showing read time durations for data from various file formats.</p>

Work is saved in Apache Parquet files, which are compatible with Apache Arrow, and designed for storage and retrieval efficiency.
Parquet is a columnar data format which may be partitioned across one or many files.
