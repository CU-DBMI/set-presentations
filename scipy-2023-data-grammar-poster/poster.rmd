Research in the [Way Lab](https://www.waysciencelab.com/) involves intensive data engineering over high-dimensional single-cell morphology data from large-scale microscopy drug screening applications.
Software development surrounding this work often entails scalability (larger than memory data handling) and understandability (syntax complexity and software sustainability) challenges.

<p class="figcaption">Figure 2. A diagram illustrating data grammar as an abstract linguistic algorithm.</p>

To address these challenges we have developed a python package called [CytoTable](https://github.com/cytomining/CytoTable) which implements "cross-language data grammar" capabilities (vocabulary + syntax = output) orchestrated with [Parsl](https://github.com/Parsl/parsl) workflows.
Our vision is for CytoTable to increase data consistency and processing capabilities, enabling more scientists quick access to single-cell insights from microscopy images.

##  <i class="fa fa-circle fa-lg"></i> Data: Apache Arrow

![Figure 3. Chart showing relative memory size for data using various Python libraries.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cytomining/CytoTable-benchmarks/main/notebooks/images/arrow-comparisons-mem-read-size.png)

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) represents a new frontier for data implementation flexibility, enabling a unified, multi-language, zero-copy format for in-memory analysis.
Arrow is like a high-performance Pandas dataframe which may be used across languages with fewer scalability challenges.

## <i class="fa fa-stream fa-lg"></i> Syntax: DuckDB SQL

![Figure 4. Chart showing read time durations of Pandas and DuckDB with SQLite databases of various sizes.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cytomining/CytoTable-benchmarks/main/notebooks/images/duckdb-comparisons-join-read-time.png)

Structured Query Language (SQL) through [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) provides an Arrow-compatible embedded database system optimized for vectorized execution.
DuckDB delivers in-memory manipulation capabilities through a SQL interface, treating variable data as a loose collection of database tables without needing conversion.

## <i class="fa fa-file-alt fa-lg"></i> Output: Apache Parquet

![Figure 5. Chart showing read time durations for data from various file formats.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cytomining/CytoTable-benchmarks/main/notebooks/images/parquet-comparisons-file-read-time-all-columns.png)

Work is saved in [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files, which are compatible with Apache Arrow, and designed for storage and retrieval efficiency.
Parquet is a columnar data format which may be partitioned across one or many files.
