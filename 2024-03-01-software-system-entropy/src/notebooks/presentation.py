# Questions in the context of software:
#
# - What are the software "messages"?
# - What are the software "probabilities"?

# + [markdown] editable=true slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"}
# __Prior work with Software Failures and Complexity Measures__
#
# Mentioned in the article:
#
# - Prior modifications to a file are a good predictor of its fault potential (i.e., the more a file is changed, the more likely it will contain faults).
#
# - Most code complexity metrics highly correlate with LOC (lines of code), a much simpler metric.
#
# - Process metrics outperform code metrics as predictors of future faults.
#
# - Prior faults are good predictors of future faults.

# + [markdown] editable=true slideshow={"slide_type": "slide"}
# __"Predicting faults using the complexity of code changes" Conjecture__
#
# - _A complex code change process negatively affects its product, the software system._
# - _The more complex changes to a file, the higher the chance the file will contain faults._

# - FI modifications context (file interactions?)
# - Files A, B, C, D are part of a software system.
# - Stars are when changes occur to the files over a certain time period (such as a week).
# - __P__ gives the probability that a file is changed in a period.

#
# - Instead of solely using the number of changes to the file, lines added or removed are summed to help build additional detail for understanding the modifications.
# - In the above example, we'd have a total of __4__ concerning the lines modified for a single file.

#
# __Files vs internal modularity__
#
# - _"... choice of files is based on the belief that a file is a conceptual unit of development where developers tend to group related entities such as functions and data types"_ (functions and other in-file modularity change based on language or style).
