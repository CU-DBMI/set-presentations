### üõ§Ô∏è Reproducing RTX-KG2 Pipeline Execution

<br>

- ["Extended Pipeline" fork on GitHub](https://github.com/CU-DBMI/RTX-KG2)
- Attempted modified Singularity-based execution on HPC Alpine: likely requires significant redesign.
- Attempting GCP VM-based execution: some progress but blocked by data requirements and existing software bugs.
  - See: [RTX-KG2#366](https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX-KG2/issues/366), [RTX-KG2#365](https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX-KG2/issues/365), [RTX-KG2#362](https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX-KG2/issues/362), [RTX-KG2#303 (comment)](https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX-KG2/issues/303#issuecomment-1915672904)
