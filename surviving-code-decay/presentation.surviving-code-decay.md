# Surviving <br>Code Decay

### <span style="color:#aaa; text-align:center;">Finding Shelter Amidst <br> Erosion and Time</span>

<!-- slide -->

## Goal

<br>

Discuss code decay and some tools which may help.

- Documentation
- Unused Code
- Environment Hazards

<!-- slide -->

## Why this matters

<br>

- üßü Eventually the things you create will decay.
- üöÄ Tools which help avoid decay may also increase your velocity.
- üß† Understanding the phenomenon is better than: <br>"this code is bad and you should feel bad too."

<!-- slide -->

## Definition

<br>

"Software rot ... is either a slow deterioration of software quality over time or its diminishing responsiveness that will eventually lead to software becoming faulty, unusable, or in need of upgrade. "

<br>

- Hours
- Days
- Months
- Years

## Documentation

<br>
Type hints in code
<br>
<br>

<table>
<tr>
<td>

````python
def example(var):
    return var[0]
````

</td>
<td>

```python
def example(var: list) -> str:
    return var[0]
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No hints</td>
<td>Type hints</td>
</tr>
</table>

<!-- slide -->

## Documentation

<br>

Type hints can be linted using [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).
This makes it easier to trace bugs over time.

Mermaid can be rendered in Github using codeblocks.
[sphinxcontrib-mermaid](https://github.com/mgaitan/sphinxcontrib-mermaid) can be used to render mermaid in Sphinx docs.

## Unused Code

<br>
<br>
It's easier to write code than it is<br> to make sure code is always used.

<!-- slide -->
## Unused Code

<br>
Unused imports
<br>
<br>

<table>
<tr>
<td>

````python
import os
import pathlib
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("example.csv")
df.head()
````

</td>
<td>

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("example.csv")
df.head()
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unused imports</td>
<td>Only what we need</td>
</tr>
</table>

<!-- slide -->
## Unused Code

<br>

[pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/warning/unused-import.html) can lint unused imports.
[nbqa](https://nbqa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) can lint notebooks (with pylint and more).

<!-- slide -->
## Unused Code

<br>
Unused blocks
<br>
<br>

<table>
<tr>
<td>

````python
def foo():
  return 1

def bar():
  return 2

foo()
````

</td>
<td>

```python
def foo():
  return 1

foo()
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unused block</td>
<td>Used block only</td>
</tr>
</table>

<!-- slide -->
## Unused Code

<br>

[Vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture) can search for unused code.<br>
Maintaining tests can sometimes <br>illuminate code usefulness (or lack thereof).

## Environment Hazards

<br>
Where will your code run?

<!-- slide -->
## Environment Hazards

```mermaid

```

Python Environment

- Python version(s)
- External Python packages (and versions)

<!-- slide -->
## Environment Hazards

![](/assets/images/2022-10-25-14-26-10.png)
Python releases have a lifecycle of their own. <https://devguide.python.org/versions/>

Development to Release

```mermaid

    your code :a, 2022-07-01, 3w
    pandas :active ,b, 2022-07-07, 1w
    numpy :active, c, 2022-07-09, 10d
    scipy :active, d, 2022-07-04, 6d
```

External Python packages have a lifecycle of their own.

<!-- slide -->
## Environment Hazards

<br>

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is one of many tools which can help address external package dependency management in Python.

<!-- slide -->
## Environment Hazards

<br>

Poetry substitutes `requirements.txt` and/or `setup.py` for specialized configuration in `pyproject.toml` and optionally locked dependencies within a `poetry.lock` file.

<!-- slide -->
## Environment Hazards

<br>

Poetry's strength (in my opinion) is simplification of virtual environemnt tasks and compatibility with centralized PyPI packages by default.

<!-- slide -->

## Environment Hazards

<br>

Poetry initialization

```shell
% cd your-repo-dir
% poetry init

This command will guide you through creating your pyproject.toml config.

Package name [poetry-test]:
Version [0.1.0]:
Description []:  a quick demonstration
Author [someone <someone@somewhere.edu>, n to skip]:
License []:  Apache 2.0
Compatible Python versions [^3.9]:
...

Running through a virtual environment <br> (without staying in it)

```shell

```

OS or Container Environment

- System dependencies (shell, filesystem)
- Procedure dependencies (Python, Java, etc)

As an author, you are also responsible for ensuring<br> other computers know how to run your code.

A related definition:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): defining computing resources and their relationships within code.

<br>

Implementing IaC tells a computer how<br> and where to run your code.

## Environment Hazards

<br>

How would you make sure someone<br> can run a shell script in your code?

- `.sh` files may not run on Windows
- `.cmd` files may not run on unix-like systems
- `Makefiles` won't run everywhere
- Command differences: `ls` vs `dir`
